1. Make sure the data structures for training, and then add the required logic code (Done)
2. Check the whole training process carefully and run some simple test cases (Not fully done)
    + Round of MCTS, Size of self-play data, Train Epochs
    + Network Train Epochs, Batch size
3. Submit it to the GPU server and get the "crude" model firstly 
4. Take careful modification to improve performance
