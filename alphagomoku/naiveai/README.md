# Naive Artificial Intelligence (Naive AI)
> Behave like intelligent creatures based on complex strategies and solution search methods

## Features
+ Totally based on the human export's experience and technologies
+ Solution search based on deep search
+ Monte-Carlo Tree will be achieved
+ Eolutionary algorithms
+ Boost and ensemble

## ToDo
+ How to define the value of point properly?  
    It seem like a game theory which try to maximize the computer value and minimize the computer value simultaneously. The definition of point value will make a huge effect on the chessboard status.
+ Need a detailed and accurate analysis of chessboard status  
    How to design a series of codes to analyze the status of chessboard? When to attack? When to defend?

## Status
Working on it

## Extra
The naive computer player will represent the highest level of human expert ability and it will become the rivals with the computer player trained by Machine learning and Deep learning. Under same game rules, which side will be final winner? it's exciting to explore: the wisdom crystal combined with human expert knowledge, or the powerful alien came from unknown computer world.
