# Neural Network and Deep Learning (AI)
> Based on the Deep Learning Technologies

This part is highly based on the open-source projects:
+ [AlphaZero_Gomoku](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku)
+ [DeepReinforcementLearning](https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/DeepReinforcementLearning)

The method for deep learning will based on [AlphaGo](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html) and [AlphaZero](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270)
